# CareFinder
> This app was developed for a class as part of a two part project - the first part being to develop a RESTful web API to serve up information about VA approved hospitals in the United States. The goal of this app is to consume the mentioned web API and demonstrate that all of the endpoints function as they should. The app on its own isn’t of much use without the web API. However, screenshots are shown below.

The app uses the following technologies/libraries/patterns:

* RxJava/RxAndroid
* Google Maps
* Google Places PlacePicker
* Kotlin
* Fuel (HTTP Networking Library)
* Android Architecture Components (ViewModel/LiveData)
* MVVM Architecture
